# === WHITESPACE HANDLING ===
#

# Various contexts in Ruby allow various kinds of whitespace
# to be used. They are grouped to clarify the lexing machines
# and ease collection of comments.

# A line of code with inline #comment at end is always equivalent
# to a line of code ending with just a newline, so an inline
# comment is deemed equivalent to non-newline whitespace
# (c_space character class).

w_space =
    c_space+
  | '\\' e_heredoc_nl
  ;


w_comment =
    '#' %{
        panic!("UNIMPL");
      // @sharp_s = p - 1
    }

    # The (p == pe) condition compensates for added "\0" and
    # the way Ragel handles EOF.
    c_line* %{
        panic!("UNIMPL");
      // emit_comment(@sharp_s, p == pe ? p - 2 : p)
    }
  ;

w_space_comment =
    w_space
  | w_comment
  ;

# A newline in non-literal context always interoperates with
# here document logic and can always be escaped by a backslash,
# still interoperating with here document logic in the same way,
# yet being invisible to anything else.
#
# To demonstrate:
#
#     foo = <<FOO \
#     bar
#     FOO
#      + 2
#
# is equivalent to `foo = "bar\n" + 2`.
